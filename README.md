# Sets

Instructions
The class should use for creating sets of "int" numbers in the range of 0…1000.
Implement the sets with a Boolean array.

Define in the class the following operations:
A constructor without parameters initializes the set as an empty set.
A constructor gets an undefined number of ints and creates a set that contains those values.
union – a union operation that receives a set and unites it with the original set. 
intersect – intersecting operation, that receives a set and performs set intersecting.
subset – an operation that receives a set and checks whether it represents a subset of the set.
isMember – an operation that receives a member and checks whether it belongs to the set.
insert – an operation that receives a member and inserts it into the set.
Delete – an operation that receives a member and deletes it from the set

Override the method ToString that inherits from Object in the following way:
ToString – will return a string representation of the set.
Equals – will check if another set has the same elements.
